## Video 1: Slot Machine Illustration
**File:** `slot-machine-illustration.mp4`
**Poster:** `slot-machine-poster.jpg`
**Section:** Industry Problem - "GenAI Video is a 'Slot Machine'"

### Veo 3.1 Prompt
```
Cinematic 8-second loop, 4K resolution, 24fps film grain:

VISUAL: A sleek, futuristic casino slot machine with three vertical display reels. Instead of fruit symbols, each reel shows AI-generated video thumbnails—some crystal clear, others blurry or glitched. The machine has a polished chrome body with neon amber and red accent lighting. A hand reaches in and pulls the lever. The reels spin with satisfying motion blur, then stop one by one: first reel lands on a beautiful cinematic frame, second lands on a mediocre result, third lands on a completely wrong output. The "JACKPOT" sign flickers disappointingly. Dollar bill symbols and credit tokens cascade down the sides, burning up with small flames as they fall. Camera slowly pushes in on the mismatched results.

MOOD: Dark, moody casino atmosphere. Neon glow. Slight haze/fog. High contrast lighting.

CAMERA: Slow push-in from medium shot to close-up on reels.

AUDIO - NARRATION (Male voice, professional documentary tone, slightly concerned):
"Every regeneration is another spin. Another gamble on your budget. How many re-rolls until you get it right?"

AUDIO - SFX:
- Mechanical lever pull (satisfying click)
- Electronic spinning sounds (digital slot machine)
- Disappointing buzzer when mismatched
- Coins/credits clinking as they fall
- Subtle fire crackle as money burns

AUDIO - MUSIC:
Tense, suspenseful underscore. Minor key synth pads with subtle pulsing bass. Think casino ambiance meets thriller tension.

## Video 2: Financial Firewall Illustration
**File:** `financial-firewall-illustration.mp4`
**Poster:** `financial-firewall-poster.jpg`
**Section:** The Solution - "The 'Financial Firewall' for Video Production"

### Veo 3.1 Prompt
```
Cinematic 8-second loop, 4K resolution, 24fps film grain:

VISUAL: A dramatic visualization of creative workflow protection. On the LEFT side of frame: chaotic, expensive AI generation represented by swirling API call visualizations, floating dollar signs that spark and burn, glitchy video artifacts, and erratic particle effects—all in aggressive reds and oranges. In the CENTER: a magnificent translucent amber/gold shield wall (like a forcefield) pulses with protective energy, hexagonal patterns rippling across its surface. Each time a "cost threat" hits the shield, it deflects with a satisfying energy ripple. On the RIGHT side: calm, organized space showing pristine storyboard frames arranged neatly, polished video thumbnails, a confident filmmaker silhouette reviewing content on a monitor. The protected side glows with serene cyan and teal tones.

MOOD: Epic, protective, empowering. Cyberpunk aesthetic meets film noir. Dark background with dramatic rim lighting.

CAMERA: Slow lateral dolly shot from left to right, revealing the transformation from chaos to control.

AUDIO - NARRATION (Male voice, confident, reassuring):
"Control your costs before you create. Not after. The Financial Firewall protects every dollar."

AUDIO - SFX:
- Electrical crackling and humming from the shield
- Deflection impacts (like energy shields in sci-fi)
- Soft ambient serenity on the protected side
- Subtle whoosh as camera moves

AUDIO - MUSIC:
Heroic, empowering underscore. Starts tense, resolves to triumphant. Orchestral synth hybrid with rising strings.
```

## Video 3: Prosumer Economy Illustration
**File:** `prosumer-economy-illustration.mp4`
**Poster:** `prosumer-economy-poster.jpg`
**Section:** Target Market - "Powering the 'Prosumer' Creator Economy"

### Veo 3.1 Prompt
```
Cinematic 8-second sequence, 4K resolution, 24fps film grain:

VISUAL: A transformative journey in split-screen style. LEFT THIRD: A solo creator sits at a laptop in a modest home office, their eyes reflecting a dream. A thought bubble/holographic projection above them shows epic cinematic frames—the film they imagine. CENTER THIRD: A glowing, magical bridge labeled "SceneFlow AI" materializes, made of flowing particles and light, connecting the two worlds. The bridge pulses with amber, purple, and cyan energy. RIGHT THIRD: The same creator, now standing confidently in front of a large cinema display showing their completed professional-quality video. Film festival laurels (Sundance, SXSW style) materialize and float around the screen. The creator raises their arms in triumph.

MOOD: Aspirational, warm, inspiring. Indie filmmaker aesthetic meets magical realism. Soft golden hour lighting on the creator, cool professional lighting on the output.

CAMERA: Smooth crane shot that rises up and pulls back, revealing the full journey from dream to reality in one continuous motion.

AUDIO - NARRATION (Male or female voice, warm, inspiring, motivational):
"Hollywood tools. Indie budget. Your story, finally told the way you imagined it."

AUDIO - SFX:
- Soft keyboard clicks at the start
- Magical whoosh as the bridge appears
- Triumphant orchestral hit when laurels appear
- Subtle crowd applause fade-in at the end

AUDIO - MUSIC:
Inspirational, uplifting underscore. Starts intimate (solo piano or acoustic), builds to full orchestral swell with strings and gentle brass. Emotional, cinematic, hopeful.

## Style Consistency Notes
- Match the cinematic quality and pacing of the existing hero-demo.mp4
- Maintain the SceneFlow AI brand colors: cyan (#06B6D4), purple (#A855F7), amber (#F59E0B)
- All videos should feel like they belong to the same "world" as the hero section
- Dark, sophisticated backgrounds with vibrant accent lighting
- Professional, not cartoonish—these are B2B/prosumer-facing visuals
