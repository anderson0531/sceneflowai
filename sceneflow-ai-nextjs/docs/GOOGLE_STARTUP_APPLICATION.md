## The Opportunity

### Market Problem

**247 million creators compete for attention. Most don't have the tools to win.**

The creator economy is exploding—projected to reach $480 billion by 2027. Short-form video (TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels) drives engagement, but production remains a bottleneck:

- **Time Barrier:** A single 60-second short-form video requires 10-15 hours of work: scripting, shooting, editing, audio mixing, and optimization
- **Skill Barrier:** Professional-quality content demands expertise in videography, editing, motion graphics, sound design, and thumbnail creation
- **Cost Barrier:** Quality video production costs $500-2,000 per minute when outsourced; equipment and software subscriptions add thousands annually
- **Speed Barrier:** Algorithm success requires consistent posting (14-21 videos/month), but production capacity limits most creators to 2-4

**The Result:** Creators choose between burning out or staying small. Most choose small.

### Market Size

- **TAM:** $480B Creator Economy (2027 projection)
- **SAM:** $52B Short-form video content tools and services
- **SOM:** $2.4B AI-assisted video production (2025, growing 38% YoY)

### Why Now?

Three converging forces make this moment unique:

1. **AI Generation Quality:** Imagen 3, DALL-E 3, and next-gen models now produce commercial-grade visuals
2. **Voice Synthesis Maturity:** ElevenLabs has achieved natural, emotive speech synthesis indistinguishable from human narration
3. **Cloud Compute Economics:** Serverless rendering (Cloud Run) enables enterprise-grade video production at consumer price points

**The window is open. The technology is ready. The market is hungry.**

## Our Solution

### SceneFlow AI: From Idea to Viral Video in Minutes

SceneFlow AI is a full-stack AI video production platform that transforms text ideas into upload-ready short-form videos. We don't just generate clips—we orchestrate complete productions.

### The Workflow

```
IDEA → BLUEPRINT → PRODUCTION → SCREENING → EXPORT
  │        │            │            │          │
  │   AI structures     │      AI voices,   Export MP4
  │   your concept   AI generates   music,      ready for
  │   into scenes    visuals with   sound FX    platform
  │                  character                  upload
  │                  consistency
  │
  └─ You provide a concept or paste existing content
```

### Core Platform Components

**1. The Blueprint (Script-to-Scene)**
- Natural language input: "Create a video about sustainable fashion for Gen Z"
- AI generates structured treatment: hook, scenes, dialogue, visual direction
- Human-in-the-loop refinement at every stage

**2. Virtual Production Studio**
- Frame-anchored character consistency using keyframe-to-keyframe identity locking
- Imagen 3 integration for photorealistic scene generation
- Dynamic scene duration based on dialogue and pacing

**3. Screening Room (Preview & Iterate)**
- Real-time video preview with audio sync
- Segment-by-segment editing and regeneration
- Protected segments to preserve approved content

**4. Director's Console (Export & Analytics)**
- One-click MP4 rendering via Cloud Run
- Format optimization for YouTube, TikTok, Instagram
- Performance tracking and content recommendations
