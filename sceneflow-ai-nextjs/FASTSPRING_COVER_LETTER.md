## 2. Why We're Addressing AI Safety Concerns Proactively

We understand that AI content generation platforms receive heightened scrutiny from payment processors. We want to be transparent about the risks inherent to our product category and demonstrate how we've implemented comprehensive safeguards.

### Common Concerns with AI Platforms

| Concern | How Other Platforms Fail | How SceneFlow Addresses |
|---------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Deepfake creation | No identity verification | **Voice Captcha** - biometric consent required |
| Celebrity impersonation | No blocking | **50+ celebrities blocked** in prompts |
| Copyright infringement | No filtering | **Character IP detection** for Disney, Marvel, DC |
| Untraceable content | No watermarking | **Forensic watermarking** on all outputs |
| Burner account abuse | No restrictions | **Tiered access** with 7-day waiting period |

---

## 3. The Four Pillars of Our AI Guardrails

We've implemented a comprehensive safety framework documented on our public **Trust & Safety page** (https://sceneflowai.studio/trust-safety):

### Pillar 1: Image Copyright Protection ✅
- **Character IP Detection** blocks prompts containing copyrighted characters (Mickey Mouse, Spider-Man, Batman, etc.)
- **Prompt sanitization** rewrites requests that attempt to circumvent blocks
- **15+ major franchises** currently protected

### Pillar 2: Video Copyright Protection ✅
- **Scene recreation detection** blocks "recreate scene from [movie]" requests
- **Forensic watermarking** via Google's SynthID embedded in all video outputs
- **Audio copyright filtering** prevents copyrighted music references

### Pillar 3: NIL (Name/Image/Likeness) Protection ✅
- **Celebrity name blocking** for 50+ public figures (actors, politicians, musicians)
- **Voice Captcha** requires live biometric consent before any voice cloning
- **ElevenLabs Voice Verification** matches consent recording to uploaded samples
- **Users cannot clone voices without physical access to the consenting person**

### Pillar 4: Community Guardrails ✅
- **OpenAI Moderation API** scans all text inputs before processing
- **Hive AI visual moderation** for generated images and video
- **NSFW, violence, and hate speech** automatically blocked
- **Tiered access** restricts high-risk features (voice cloning) to verified, paid accounts
- **Audit logging** tracks User ID + Prompt + Output for traceability

## 7. What Sets Us Apart

Unlike many AI content tools, SceneFlow AI:

1. **Prevents abuse before it happens** - Content is moderated at the prompt level, not after generation
2. **Requires identity verification** - Voice cloning requires live biometric consent
3. **Maintains full traceability** - Every generation is logged and watermarked
4. **Restricts high-risk features** - New accounts cannot immediately access cloning
5. **Documents everything publicly** - Our Trust & Safety page is comprehensive and transparent
